DELETE: E' = { (A,B) in E }, G = (V,E)
------
Essentially, for each edge (A,B) to be deleted:
  - Check if the nodes A, B are in the same SCC
    - If they are NOT in the same SCC, just delete the edge 
      and remove them from the inter-SCC edges
    - If they ARE from the same SCC, keep track of the SCC
  - For each of the affected SCCs:
    - Run a limited version of Tarjan's algorithm:
      - Only consider the nodes/edges within the SCC
      - This generates a new set of SCCs
    - Use the generated components mapping and inverse index 
      on the components mapping to update the graph's internal
      data structures
    - Maintain the intra-SCC and inter-SCC edges:

G contains:
  - a mapping of SCC to nodes --> SCC
  - a mapping of node to SCC ---> inverse_SCC

PSEUDOCODE:
def remove_edges(E'):
  check_scc = set()

  for (A,B) in E':
    delete (A,B) from E
    if SCC(A) == SCC(B):
      check_scc.add(SCC(A))
      delete (A,B) from A's intracomponent edges
    else:
      delete (A,B) from A's intercomponent edges

  # Go through all the SCCs that are affected
  for scc in check_edges:
    run tarjan's algorithm on the scc in question, only considering nodes/edges within the scc

--------
  ADD: E' = { (A,B) in E }, G = (V,E) 
--------
This is the harder case.
For each edge (A,B) to be added:
  - Check if the nodes A, B are in the same SCC
    - If they ARE in the same SCC, just add the edge and insert
      into the inter-SCC data structure
    - If they are NOT in the same SCC, keep track of the edges
  - Build a forward mapping of edges (node to list of neighbors)
    as well as the reverse mapping (for the reverse graph)
    - Keep track of which nodes are in the existing graph (for 
    graft case)
  - For all the overlapping nodes (the ones in the existing graph),
    check if there are any inbound edges (check reverse graph)
      - If there are, this is NOT a graft case, and we need to do
        a full re-compute.
      - If there aren't any, then we can handle the graft case:
        1. Insert the edges into the existing graph.
        2. Run a limited Tarjan's algorithm starting from one of 
           the graft case nodes and only traverse those nodes.
        3. Merge the resulting components mapping and inverse index
           into the graph's internal data structures.
