Fully Dynamic SCC Maintenance Algorithm
----
Research in-progress as part of prototyping work for [LogicBlox](http://www.logicblox.com), based off of [Roditty and Zwick's paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1007387&dl=ACM&coll=DL&CFID=446154922&CFTOKEN=78521305)


Overview
---
The algorithm maintains the strongly connected components (SCCs) of a sequence of graphs G<sub>1</sub>, ..., G<sub>t</sub>, where `t` is the number of insert operations performed so far. 

Supported Operations:

* `Insert(E')` - Create a new version of the graph, initially identical to the latest version of the graph, and add the set of edges `E'` to it
* `Delete(E')` - Delete the set of edges `E'` from <i>all</i> versions of the graph
* `Query(u, v, i)` - Check if `u, v` are in the same SCC of the <i>i</i>th version of the graph
